# Lab 5 exercise for CMPINF_0010

**What it does:** This program asks you for your name, and then asks you if you'd like to run function 1, 2, or 3. 

* Function 1 asks for the lengths of two legs of a triangle and calculates the length of the third leg using the Pythagorean Theorem.
* Function 2 prints the name of the user backwards. 
* Function 3 returns the user's number square rooted plus 1000. 

**How to install:**  The file is an .ipynb file. We recommend cloning the file here on Github and then opening it in Jupyter Lab for best results. The file should show up as Lab5-Exercise-Main-Program-checkpoint.ipynb .

**How to use:** You can run this program in the IDE of your choice. Right now, the program can only perform functions 1, 2, and 3. If you try to input a different function number, the program will tell you it is invalid. 



**How to contribute:** We'd love you to contribute! If you have an idea for a cool function you'd like to add, go for it! Just give the function a new number. Before contributing, make sure to read our Code of Conduct. We want all contributors to be respectful of one another. To contribute, the first step would be to fork the repository here on Github. Once you've made your changes, submit a pull request. We'll then look at your changes, and if they align with our goal for the program, we'll commit your changes to the main program! 

**License:** This program uses the Apache license. We chose this license because it doesn't have restrictions and is pretty open, it also doesn't require derivative works to include the same license so that makes it slightly more open for other people to come and work with it.
